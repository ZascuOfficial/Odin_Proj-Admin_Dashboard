						<h4 class="topic-title">School Breaks</h4>

						<p class="topic-body">
							I consider school breaks to be one of the most important periods of time in a student's day.
							They help consolidate the information a person has just absorbed into their mind while also providing a good opportunity to rest and do something else other than learning.
							That is why I wish they were a little longer.

						<h4 class="topic-title">Night over Day</h4>

						<p class="topic-body">
							Some people prefer doing their usual activities during the night instead of during the day, for various reasons.
							One might be forced by the job they currently have, or maybe it's just an unusual preference they have.
							Either way, it's important to remember to get lots of sleep, regardless of what time of day you choose to get rest in.

						<h4 class="topic-title">Importance of Music</h4>

						<p class="topic-body">
							Music is one of the remedies that helps you in many cases.
							Sometimes it's good for you because it may help you to relax, other times it's also very useful for getting yourself hyped up for an event that might require physical effort, such as a long marathon or a workout session.

						<h4 class="topic-title">Cool Movies</h4>

						<p class="topic-body">
							Over the past years or so, there have been a number of amazingly done movies that came out.
							Some examples of these movies could be Sonic the Hedgehog and it's sequel, Avatar: the way of the water, and of course, Puss in boots: the last wish.
							I recommend you all to watch them if you haven't already.

						<h4 class="topic-title">Parkour</h4>

						<p class="topic-body">
							Ever done parkour?
							The act of performing parkour is similar to the one of simply running, but with added steps, such as jumping over obstacles that may appear in front of you during your running session.
							The most important thing about parkour is that it doesn't matter what you jump over, but how you do it.
							It all comes down to style.

						<h4 class="topic-title">The Beauty of Silence</h4>

						<p class="topic-body">
							Sometimes it's nice to just calm down, stop what you're doing and listen to the sound of silence.
							You might think that this would be pointless, but studies have shown that it's very beneficial to take some time off from all the every-day chaos and enjoy a moment of silence from time to time.
